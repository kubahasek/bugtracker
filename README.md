# BUGTRACKER

This is an app I created to practice writing a full stack app. I created the app using the `Create T3 App` command.
It uses a mySQL database with Prisma as the ORM and tRPC to handle backend stuff. There is a lot more to be done if I ever come back to it but for now I am happy with this.
